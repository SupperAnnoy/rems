        <h2>1st International Workshop on Reliable and Efficient Multi-agent Services (REMS 2025)</h2>
        <p>The 1st International Workshop on Reliable and Efficient Multi-agent Services (REMS) aims to explore emerging techniques and frameworks that support robust, scalable, and trustworthy collaboration among intelligent agents in dynamic service environments. As intelligent agents become integral to complex service ecosystems—spanning logistics, industrial automation, smart cities, and cloud-edge systems—there is a growing need to ensure reliable coordination, autonomous decision making, and efficient task execution across heterogeneous platforms.</p>

        <p>This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners to present novel contributions in agent-based service architectures, decentralized service planning, coordination protocols, fault-tolerant service orchestration, and trustworthy data exchange among distributed agents. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reliable multi-agent orchestration in dynamic service contexts</li>
          <li>Agent-as-a-Service design and deployment</li>
          <li>Robust negotiation and planning under uncertainty</li>
          <li>Cloud-edge collaboration for multi-agent systems</li>
          <li>Trust models for agent-based service collaboration</li>
          <li>Cross-agent learning and knowledge transfer</li>
          <li>Lightweight coordination for resource-constrained agents/ on-device agents</li>
          <li>Formal models and verifiable guarantees for agent behaviors</li>
          <li>Security and privacy protection for multi-agent systems</li>
          <li>Multi-modal data governance for Agent-as-a-Service</li>
        </ul>
		  
		<p>By focusing on the foundational challenges of reliability and efficiency in intelligent multi-agent services, REMS offers a dedicated forum to shape the next generation of AI-enabled, service-driven systems.</p>
